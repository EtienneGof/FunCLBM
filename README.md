# FunCLBM: Functional Conditional Latent Block Model
Implementation of Functional Conditional Latent Block Model

This repository contains the Scala / Spark source code that implements the time series co-clustering method FunCLBM

## Quick start

The build.sh script helps the user build the project using maven, and run.sh launches a series of model inference on simulated dataset (with pre-parametred SEM-Gibbs)
